A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/samirc/pen/WQORrx.

 This is my Pure CSS Solar System, it's gotten fun creating things from just CSS, I will do it more and get better, slowly, but surely :) 

P.S. If anyone is curious as to how this was made, just add this to the CSS:

* { border:1px solid red } 

(It's just circles and squares!)
